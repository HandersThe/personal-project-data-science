# Personal Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of personal projects.

## About

This collection serves as a portfolio of my work and a demonstration of my skills and interests in data science related field that I deemed not big enough for a seperate repository.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README.

## Contributing

As these are personal projects, contributions are not actively sought. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
